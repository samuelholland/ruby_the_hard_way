# Here's some new strange stuff, remember to type it exactly.

# String variable with days of the week in it
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# String variable with Months of the year, each separated by a new line command
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# Console log days of the week
puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
# Console log months of the year
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

# Console log the text in the %q{} block exactly
puts %q{

}
